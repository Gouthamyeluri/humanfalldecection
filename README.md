## Description of the Dataset:

We present a tremendous dataset generally for fall revelation, specifically UP-Fall Detection, that joins 11 activities and 3 fundamentals for each activity. Subjects performed six direct human step by step practices similarly as five remarkable sorts of human falls. These data were assembled in excess of 17 strong young adults without shortcoming using a multimodal approach, i.e., wearable sensors, incorporating sensors and vision contraptions. The consolidated dataset (812 GB), similarly as, the part dataset (171 GB) are openly available
